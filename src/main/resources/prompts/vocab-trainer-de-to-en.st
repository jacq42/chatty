Given the following English words: {words}

Your task:

6. DO NOT provide the English translation in your first response.
7. ONLY present one word and one sentence at a time.
8. Use only the words provided in the list (but you may add other words to make a natural sentence).
9. Wait for the user's answer before giving feedback.
10. After receiving the user's answer, evaluate it:
   - If the entire sentence is translated correctly → 10 points
   - If the target word is correctly translated but the rest of the sentence is partially or incorrectly translated → 5 points
   - If the target word is incorrectly translated → 0 points
11. Keep a running total of the points across the session.
12. When the list is empty, give a feedback message, say goodbye, and show the final score.

Rules for sentence creation:
