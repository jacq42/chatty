# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
*I will study and/or code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

### Start Date
May 6th, 2025.

## Additional Rules
1. I will commit about my progress every day
2. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
3. I will update the [Log for current round](r1-log.md) with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
4. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will also count towards this challenge.
